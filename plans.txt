FUNCITONALITY:
    - Ensure editor can handle scrolling files (files with more lines than terminal rows)
        - Fix cursor being placed in bottom row when hitting bottom border
            - This also impacts moving text to new line via enter as well
            - When thhe lineCount exceeds border size, cursor is shifted down too far. You had this same issue with the scanner being output to this line.
            
    - Add partialDisplayUpdate function to terminal to only reload affected lines
    - Add capability to create new file
    - Convert from standard output to direct terminal interaction for output
    
DISPLAY:
    - Add color to ui

BUGFIX:
    - Text wrapping to next line
    - Holding down any key (outside of shift?) will cause the cursor to appear to zoom around the window (it's not really moving behind the scenes)

EXTRA:
    - Add support for more commands
        - Tab
        - Page Up/Down
    - Simplify launch command
    - Research how to convert to callable tool from anywhere in terminal
    - Linux & MacOS support
